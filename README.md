# face-music

A demo for using face recognition api for making music fun.

In this demo, we use other two libraries:
- use face-api.js(https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js/) to detect the mouth change for emotion justification.
- use tone.js(https://tonejs.github.io/) to process audio for changing the voice dynamically.

After your run this demo, the camera will capture your face and try to identify your emotion as happy, sad, angry or fear, and play the according voice.
